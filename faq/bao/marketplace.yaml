title: Does It Work on the Marketplace?
body: |
    **Not allowed**
    - Anything beta
    - Anything experimental
    - Shaders
    - Guns, drugs, violence, religion etc.

    **Allowed**
    Everything that isn't shown above. Custom items for example are allowed, as long as you don't use the new experimental components.

    Pretty much, if it works in a non-beta, non-experimental world, and it isn't using scripts or shaders, its good.

    **Why did I see a map using Experimental?**
    Some maps get special permission from Microsoft to use Experimental. These are usually free, or intended specifically to show-off the new creator-features. You are unlikely to get the same permission.
